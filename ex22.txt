print - prints information to standard out. You can print concatenated strings seperated by ',' and with variable names in between. You can also print a string and substitute special formatter types (%s, %r, %i) with variables that following a '%' symbol after the print statement. If you have a lot of variable substitutions, you put them in brackets and seperate them with a ','.
